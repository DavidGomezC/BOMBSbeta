# Inference for Stan model: PLacExample_Stan_test_model
# 3 chains: each with iter=(20,20,20); warmup=(0,0,0); thin=(1,1,1); 60 iterations saved.
#
# Warmup took (0.73, 0.43, 0.28) seconds, 1.4 seconds total
# Sampling took (2.1, 1.2, 0.70) seconds, 4.1 seconds total
#
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
